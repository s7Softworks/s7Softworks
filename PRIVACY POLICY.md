Welcome to the Tip Calculator App for Android!

This app was developed by David Anthony. This app is available on Google Play.

As an Android user myself, I take privacy very seriously. I know how irritating it is when apps collect your data without your knowledge.

I have not programmed this app to collect any personally identifiable information. All data such as app preferences (like Dark Mode, or currency) is stored on your device only, and can be simply erased by clearing the app's data or uninstalling it.

Please note that while I do not personally collect any information, I do use third party service providers such as: 
  - [Google Play Services](https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/)
  - [Google AdMob](https://support.google.com/admob/answer/6128543?hl=en)

If you find any security vulnerability that has been inadvertently caused by me, or have any question regarding the app and your privacy, please send me an email and I will do my best to try and fix it/help you.

Thank you for downloading my app and I hope you find it useful!
